At least on chicago there are very few dev dependencies installed.
Try using conda to satisfy the library dependendcies, and may also simplify
using DFM/DWAQ.

The intel compilers are supposed to be binary compatible with gnu compilers.

conda create -n dfm_t140737 python=3 libnetcdf netcdf-fortran zlib proj libtiff gdal libuuid

(strictly speaking it might be sufficient to just get libgdal, but it will be useful down
 the road to have the python bindings)

Originally tried to have conda install metis, but there were some compile issues with dfm.
Well, not so fast. Using local compile gave identical results.

unstruct_bmi.F90: 
subroutine write_partition_metis(c_netfile_in, c_netfile_out, c_npart, c_jacontiguous) bind(C, name="write_partition_metis")

character(kind=c_char), intent(in)       :: c_netfile_in(MAXSTRLEN)

The argument is over MAXSTRLEN I think.

Earlier in unstruc_bmi.F90:
  integer(c_int), BIND(C, name="MAXSTRLEN") :: MAXSTRLEN = 1024

Hmm - I figured write_partition_metis was somehow from metis, but it's not.



conda activate dfm_t140737

make build-mpich
make build-petsc (one test fails, about 6400 pass, some are skipped)

For some reason conda doesn't add itself to PKG_CONFIG_PATH. This should be fixed now
in prepenv.sh. Alternatively this will do it:

  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:$CONDA_PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig

but prepenv.sh also sets LD_LIBRARY_PATH and LIBRARY_PATH which are needed in later steps.

ifort cannot use gfortran's module files. 

make build-dfm


conda can supply libuuid, but dfm isn't finding it.
